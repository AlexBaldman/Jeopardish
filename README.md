# Project Overview

## Project Name

Jeopardish

## Project Description

A Jeopardy question & answer practice application, along the lines of flash cards for Jeopardy questions

## API and Data Sample

[jService.io](www.jService.io)

```JSON

{
  "id":6995,
  "answer":"liberty",
  "question":"One-word term for an authorized leave from duty; to a sailor it means freedom for 48 hours or less",
  "value":200,
  "airdate":"1990-01-23T12:00:00.000Z",
  "created_at":"2014-02-11T22:50:54.251Z",
  "updated_at":"2014-02-11T22:50:54.251Z",
  "category_id":914,
  "game_id":null,
  "invalid_count":null,
  "category": 
    {
    "id":914,
    "title":"the navy","created_at":"2014-02-11T22:50:54.061Z","updated_at":"2014-02-11T22:50:54.061Z","clues_count":5
    }
}
```

## Wireframes

< PLACEHOLDER FOR WIREFRAMES >

Upload images of your wireframes to an image hosting site or add them to an assets folder in your repo and link them here with a description of each specific wireframe.

### MVP/PostMVP

The functionality will then be divided into two separate lists: MPV and PostMVP.  Carefully decided what is placed into your MVP as the client will expect this functionality to be implemented upon project completion.  

#### MVP 

- Pull random Jeopardy practice question/answer pairs - like flashcards for Jeopardy practice - from external API
- Render data on page
- Style displayed data so that it appears in a word-bubble coming from our host, Mr. Alex Trebek

NOTE - at first, may just be both the question and answer appearing together.


#### PostMVP  

- Post MVP, "Jeopardish" may possibly evolve into "JeopOrDad" by integrating a second API
- The core idea here is that the user now randomly receives EITHER a random Jeopardy question OR a random "Dad Joke" - because let's face it: Trebek is a corny Dad if there ever was one
- This second API that I have in mind is [ICanHazDadJoke](icanhazdadjoke.com/api)

## Project Schedule

You are **responsible** for scheduling time with your squad to seek approval for each deliverable by the end of the corresponding day, excluding `Saturday` and `Sunday`.

|June 8| Project Prompt | In Progress
|June 9| Wireframes / Priority Matrix / Timeframes | Incomplete
|June 10| Core Application Structure (HTML, CSS, etc.) | Incomplete
|June 11| Initial Clickable Model  | Incomplete
|June 12| MVP | Incomplete
|June 15| Present | Incomplete

## Priority Matrix

< PLACEHOLDER FOR PRIORITY MATRIX IMAGE >

## Timeframes

An estimate of the amount of time I'm planning to spend on each area of development:

Time frames are also key in the development cycle.  You have limited time to code all phases of the game.  Your estimates can then be used to evalute game possibilities based on time needed and the actual time you have before game must be submitted. It's always best to pad the time by a few hours so that you account for the unknown so add and additional hour or two to each component to play it safe. Throughout your project, keep track of your Time Invested and Actual Time and update your README regularly.

| Component | Priority | Estimated Time | Time Invested | Actual Time |
| Pseudocode Site Functionality | M |  3hrs | TBD | TBD |
| Adding Form | H | 5hrs| TBD | TBD |
| Working with API | H | 4hrs| TBD | TBD |
| Total | H | 12hrs| TBD | TBD |

## Code Snippet

Stay tuned to this section, where I'll include brief code snippets of functionality I was proud of and a brief description of each:

```
function reverse(string) {
	// As an example, here's some code I might use to reverse a string of text
  // Exciting times!!!
}
```

## Change Log
 This section will be used to document changes that were made and the reasoning behind them.
